# BANANAdiseasePrediction

The main idea of this project is to predict Banana plant disease by using images of diseased parts of the plant. Here, three different diseases are predicted such as sigatoka, pestalotiopsis, cardona.

In this project, we first begin with preprocessing  the dataset, preparation of the model using Convolutionnal Neural Network(CNN) , predicting the training and validation accuracy and loss and made the model predict the type of disease it is being affected on a single image which can be viewed in BANDIS.ipynb.

In app.py we saved the CNN model as banana.h5 and loaded it , if we run the code in app.py you will directed to the website which asks you to upload the image of banana leaf and if we click on predict, it predicts the disease that the leaf is being affected.
